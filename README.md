# Easy, straightforward interaction with [dtnd](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-go)

Interact with the [UNIX Application agent](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-go/tree/main/pkg/application_agent/unix_agent) of `dtn7`.

This package can be used as either a library or directly as a cli client.

Then main entrypoint for library usage are the functions in [client.py](dtnclient/client.py).

For cli usage, see `dtnclient --help`.
